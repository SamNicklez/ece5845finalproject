# Project README

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive application leveraging Python, Flask, Neo4j, and the Graph Data Science (GDS) library version 4.4.28. It is designed to utilize the powerful features of these technologies, offering a robust backend system with advanced data processing and graph database capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Flask:** A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, used for building the web API. Install Flask via pip:
   
   ```bash
   pip install Flask
   ```

3. **Neo4j:** A highly scalable native graph database, which allows for efficient management and querying of connected data. Download and install Neo4j from [neo4j.com](https://neo4j.com/download/).

4. **Graph Data Science (GDS) Library 4.4.28:** A library for Neo4j, enabling advanced analytics and machine learning on graphs. Ensure that you are using GDS version 4.4.28, compatible with your Neo4j version. Refer to the [Neo4j GDS installation guide](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/installation/) for detailed instructions.
